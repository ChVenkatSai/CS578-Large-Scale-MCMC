# CS578-Large-Scale-MCMC
This is the project for the course CS578: Statistical Machine Learning. The project is a compilation of large scale MCMC methods such as Adaptive metropolis, Mini-batch metropolis, Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis and Hamilton Monte Carlo, suitable for complex datasets and distributions. Provided are also some experiments to compare the algorithms.
